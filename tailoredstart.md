This is my new project and the goal is to simplify for you to improve your vocabulary in a foreign language. The idea is quite simple. Translating a word or a phrase with *TailoredDictionary* a flashcard is created simultaneously. If you are reading a book for example, you can translate words you do not understand and you will see a list of translation for that session. Simultaneously the words are saved and you can practice on them afterwards.

You can find the app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.erikbylow.tailoreddictfire">

</a>.


After words are added you can either train on flashcards:

Alternatively, you can train your spelling:

Please note that for languages that are not alphabetic it might be required to turn on *Hints*.
